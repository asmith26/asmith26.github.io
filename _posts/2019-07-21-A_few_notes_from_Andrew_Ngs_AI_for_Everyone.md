### **AI Strategy**
- Strategic data acquisition
- Unified data warehouse
- New roles (e.g. Machine Learning Engineer)

### **ML tends to work well when:**
- Learning a “simple” concept
- Lot of data available
- Think about automating tasks rather than automating jobs. (What are the main drivers of business value? What are the main pain points in your business?)

### **Key steps of a Machine Learning project:**
1. Collect data
2. Train model (iterate many times until good enough)
3. Deploy model (get data back; maintain/update model)

### **Key steps of a Data Science project:**
1. Collect data
2. Analyse data (iterate many times to get good insights)
3. Suggest hypotheses/actions (deploy changes; re-analyze new data periodically)
