## **Mathematical Statements**

Definitions and Propositions/Theorems/… normally take the form:
1. Object $$a$$ has property $$P$$.
> $$3$$ is prime.
2. Every object of type $$T$$ has property $$P$$.
> Every integer $$\ge1$$ is prime or can be represented as the product of primes, uniquely.
3. There exist objects of type $$T$$ having property $$P$$.
> There exist infinite sets with different sizes.
4. If statement $$A$$, then statement $$B$$.
> If a function $$f$$ is both injective and surjective, then $$f$$ is bijection.

## **List some problem solving strategies**
- What are you trying to answer? 
- Do you understand all notation/terminology?
- Can you draw a table/graph/picture to describe what’s going on?

<p/>

- Can you identify exactly why you are stuck?
- Simplify the problem/consider simple cases (when $$x = 0, 1, 2,...$$; when $$x$$ is real, integer,…; limiting cases).

<p/>

- Make conjectures and assumptions — do they initially break down?
- Which theorems can be used based on the assumptions?

<p/>

- Patterns? Similar examples?
- What strategies are used for similar problems like this?

<p/>

- Is it better to work backwards?

<p/>

- Create a concept map (quantity not quality). Which ideas are worth following?

<p/>

- Take a break/walk (use the deep mind to solve unconsciously).

<p/>

Review:
- Check all calculations and logic hold.
- Dimensional analysis: Is the answer dimensionally correct? Does the size/sign seem reasonable?
- Can you check using a different method?
