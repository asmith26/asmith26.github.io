**TL;DR — I believe [Data (computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_%28computing%29).**

Wikipedia says "[**_Abstraction_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction) *in its main sense is a conceptual process by which general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples."* So one could argue that the most abstract thing is where the process of **abstraction converges** to a single point for any (specific) example; this unique point I believe is data.

In particular, I feel that everything could be encoded as data e.g. (from the Wikipedia example [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction#Simplification_and_ordering))

> *(0) Data (to observe this step, note that the publication was most likely written on a computer, or could easily be inputted into a computer — which represents everything as binary data)*

> *(4) the May 18 edition of the The San Francisco Chronicle*

> *(6) my copy of the May 18 edition of the The San Francisco Chronicle as it was when I first picked it up (as contrasted with my copy as it was a few days later: in my fireplace, burning)* 

Other things that we have converted to binary data for manipulating via a computer include: sound waves, the rules of the universe for simulating the Big Bang, and the building blocks of life, DNA, encode information also.

Thus, can data explain everything? I believe it can (perhaps we are just living inside [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix), and our external physical reality is a [mathematical universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis)). But I think the really important question is how do we efficiently encode things as data (e.g. a human brain) for easy manipulation on a computer?
