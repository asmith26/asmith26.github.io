Wikipedia says "[**_Abstraction_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction) *in its main sense is a conceptual process by which general rules and concepts
are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples."* So one could argue that the most abstract thing is 
where the process of **abstraction converges** to a single point for any (specific) example. Here is a nice 
[example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction#Simplification_and_ordering) from the Wikipedia page:

> *(1) a publication*
>
> *(2) a newspaper*
>
> *(3) The San Francisco Chronicle*
>
> *(4) the May 18 edition of The San Francisco Chronicle*  
>
> *(5) my copy of the May 18 edition of The San Francisco Chronicle* 
>
> *(6) my copy of the May 18 edition of The San Francisco Chronicle as it was when I first picked it up (as contrasted with my copy as it was a few days later: in my fireplace, burning)* 

We encode many things as binary data for manipulation on a computer such as bullet point *(1) a publication* from above, in addition to things like the rules of the universe for simulating the Big Bang.
So possibly binary data is the most important abstract concept (perhaps we are living inside [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix))? On the other hand life uses DNA to represent genetic information.

Perhaps the important question is thus how do we efficiently encode things as data, so that it can be used to help us solve problems?
